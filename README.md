# BRIGHT-COFFEE-SHOP

Bright-Coffee-Analytics

This project is all about analyzing coffee shop sales data to give helpful insights to the new CEO.

I worked with a dataset that tracked daily transactions at a coffee shop. The idea behind the project was that a new CEO had recently joined and needed insights to help grow revenue and improve product performance. As a Junior Data Analyst, I explored the historical data and put together a presentation with useful takeaways to support decision-making.

Hereâ€™s what I looked into:

Which products bring in the most revenue

The time of day when the store performs best

Sales trends over time and across different products

Suggestions for boosting sales performance

Tools I used:

SQL (Snowflake): To add extra columns and make the analysis easier

Excel: For digging into the data and creating visuals

Miro: To plan out the steps and keep the project organized
